 <h1>Summary</h1>           <p>Many students in American public schools succeed academically and graduate on the road to a happy, successful life. That's not to say, however, that their schooling can be given full credit for their prosperity. In fact, many other students slip through the cracks and end up facing hardship, uncertainty, unemployment, lack of purpose in life, or even involvement with the criminal justice system. Understaffing, overcrowding, budget cuts, and a passive, punitive school climate all reduce the quality of K-12 education. Students are expected to follow a regimented routine and dozens of rules during the school day but do little more than learn rote facts and fill out worksheets. Those who succeed do because of financial prosperity, strong families, and stability outside the classroom. Reformers should thus focus on setting up for success those students who lack that stability and support.</p>
          </div>
          <div  class='popup' id='tough-love'>
            <h1>Use tough love</h1>
            <p>Despite being heavy-handed on discipline policies, public schools are very lenient regarding academic performance. <a href='https://www.educationworld.com/a_admin/admin/admin040.shtml'>Failing students are often passed to the next grade</a>, which is done to avoid not only the negative effects of retention but also funding cuts (more on that later). But this has caused <a href='https://www.nuroretention.com/blog/officials-80-percent-of-recent-nyc-high-school-graduates-cannot-read'>rising numbers of high school graduates</a> to lack basic academic and job skills. Clearly, schools need to provide more attention to struggling students, for example through mandatory counseling, basic life skills training, and personalized success plans. Equally important, though, is communicating the sheer importance of education and skill-building to real-world success so that students don't feel like they're being bossed around or punished.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='manage'>
            <h1>Stop micromanaging students</h1>
            <p>This ties in closely with tough love. <a href='https://classroommanagementexpert.com/blog/why-is-freedom-important-in-the-classroom/'>Students need freedom </a>(within reason) to build responsibility. Strict rules take away the opportunity to make choices and suffer the consequences of said choices (aside from immediate punishment). Chronic tardiness, for instance, should result in constructive coachings and grade-deductions. Detentions aren't going to instill punctuality; a glimpse into potential real-world consequences (like a difficult conversation with a manager) might. Students should be given the right to choose and learn from their choices. Freedom also helps teach critical thinking and communication skills while making students feel respected and less likely to misbehave.</p>

          <div class='popup' id='security'>
            <h1>Reduce spending on security</h1>
            <p>Schools should be safe places to learn but are sadly plagued by crime. Fighting, gang activity, illegal drug use, and even homicide occur. Amidst several high-profile mass shootings, many schools have installed <a href='https://www.masslive.com/news/2015/05/5_reasons_metal_detectors_in_school_are_bad.html'>metal detectors</a>  and hired <a href='https://www.aclu-wa.org/story/school-resource-officers-when-cure-worse-disease'>School Resource Officers (SROs)</a>. But these reactive, feel-good interventions have caused suspensions and arrests, especially of students of color, to skyrocket while not improving school safety at all. Schools should instead enact <a class='intrasite' href='#change'>deep, systemic change</a> that touches youth at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system, for example by cultivating a sense of community and "togetherness" on campus. </p>
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='change'>
            <h1>An Example of Deep, Real Change</h1>
            <p>Amidst several high-profile mass shootings, schools should focus on the root causes behind such violence, <a href='https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762'>which are well-researched</a>. Lessons in <a href='https://www.advisausa.com/2020/08/self-awareness-and-the-ego/'>self-awareness</a> and empathy must be integrated into cirricula to enable students to recognize the warning signs in both themselves and others. Furthermore, teachers and counselors must monitor students for such signs and take action if appropriate, such as mandatory student-parent-teacher conferences to ensure students remain successful and away from crime and violence.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='college'>
            <h1>Offer alternatives to college</h1>
            <p>American high schools heavily preach college preparation. After all, data clearly show college grads' earnings trump those with just a diploma. But higher ed is plagued by exorbitant tuition and high dropout rates; clearly, it is not for everyone. Thus, high schools should offer other pathways, like trade or "voc ed" classes. <a href='https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2014/09/09/the-troubled-history-of-vocational-education'>Voc ed</a> has been around for decades but has faced criticism for creating <i>de facto</i> racial segregation, as many impoverished and minority students would opt for it. Its popularity eroded with the passage of regulations like No Child Left Behind. <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholaswyman/2015/09/01/why-we-desperately-need-to-bring-back-vocational-training-in-schools/?sh=6b60c2e87add'>But many vocational students today succeed</a>, landing high-paying skilled blue-collar jobs. They face <a href='https://cetweb.edu/trade-school-vs-college-what-finance-experts-have-to-say/'>less student-loan debt</a> and graduate faster than university students.
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='learning'>
            <h1>Teach learning itself</h1>
            <p>One common complaint from public school students is that many subjects they learn, like chemistry and ancient history, are inapplicable to adult life. That is true, to an extent. Sure, the information itself may possibly be useless outside of academia. But the important part is the <a href='https://cei.umn.edu/teaching-resources/active-learning/why-use-active-learning#:~:text=Active%20learning%20improves%20student%20outcomes&text=The%20benefits%20to%20using%20such,failure%20(Prince%2C%202004).'>learning process</a>, rather than the results or even what is learned. For instance, history lessons discuss many controversial figures and events students can debate. These less passive and more active learning methods cultivate critical thinking and open-mindedness (<a class='intrasite' href='#crt'>as long as educators have the freedom to do so</a>) Rather than grading students based on rote memorization tests, schools should grade them based on their ability to learn, engage, and take the initiative.
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='crt'>
            <h1>A Special Note on Conservative Censorship</h1>
            <p>Unfortunately, Republicans in recent years are threatening academic freedom. Politicians in states like Florida, Texas, and Utah have <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-book-bans-streak-of-extremism'>banned</a> many pro-racial justice and pro-LGBTQ+ books from school libraries. <a href='https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/four-states-have-placed-legal-limits-on-how-teachers-can-discuss-race-more-may-follow/2021/05'>Right-wing governors</a> have enacted vague yet harsh laws threatening honest discussions about the harsh realities behind our country's history. It's similar to how narcissistic, ego-driven people refuse to take accountability for their mistakes and deny their problems; American cannot progress further if it refuses to take accountability for its past.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='popup' id='funding'>
            <h1>INCREASE FUNDING!</h1>
            <p>Perhaps the most important step leaders can take to help our youth is to increase funding for public schools. Students simply cannot receive support they may not be getting at home without significant monetary investments into education. Increased teacher pay, an obvious benefit of greater funding, would attract more to the profession and ease overcrowding and <a href='https://abcnews.go.com/US/map-shows-us-states-dealing-teaching-shortage-data/story?id=96752632'>staffing shortages</a>. In fact,  teacher salaries are perhaps the most important funding metric and <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/us-education-spending-finland-south-korea'> correlate</a> with improved <a class='intrasite' href='#scores'>academic performance</a> better than per-pupil spending. Also, existing funds must be reallocated, e.g. by replacing cops with counselors.
