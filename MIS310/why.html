                     <p>Powerful people, groups, and businesses do everything they can to retain their might, even if their actions are not in the best interest of the people. Politicians may push dubious narratives to retain voters, and corporations sponsor questionable research to decrease the credibility of those opposed to their interests. Furthermore, as shown above, the fallout from environmental destruction is <a href='https://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/8/15/racial-disparities-and-climate-change' target='_blank'>uneqally distributed</a>, most potent in countries that contribute to it the least as well as marginalized, minority-dominated communities within wealthy nations.

                     <p>Frontend businesses, like grocery stores and restaurants, actually bear more responsibility here than consumers. The section title "<span class='i'>Consumer</span> Behavior" simply distinguishes these customer-facing establishments from large, backend corporations like the industrial producers who aim to maximize yields and savings. But consumers still indirectly enable unsustainable business practices.</figcaption>

                         <p>Consumerism and commercialization are two major facets of modern capitalism. You've seen it, even without realizing it: huge holiday decorations, entire aisles of Halloween candy, and mile-long lines at the drive-thru. The excessive selling and spending is certainly not a problem in and of itself; the issue lies with the waste generated from all that consumerism. Americans generate <a href='https://brightly.eco/blog/holiday-waste-generation-and-prevention#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20produces%205,or%2043.75%20pounds%20each%20week.' target='_blank'>25% more daily trash</a> between Christmas and New Year's than at other times of the year. Consumerism also drives waste of the following items:</p>

                        <p>A harsh reality is that one single person can do little for the planet. Modifying unsustainable routines burdens all individuals who do so, but the population will only benefit if <span class='i'>everyone</span> makes those sacrifices. To mitigate this issue, governments and businesses must focus on its root causes, which include:</p>

                     <p>A cold, hard truth is that there are simply too many of us. Each human requires food, water, and shelter, which all consume Earth's natural resources.

Today, with even higher numbers of both humans and cars, nations are building new roads in an attempt to mitigate ever-increasing congestion.
